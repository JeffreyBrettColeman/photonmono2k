# Photon Mono 2k LCD Polerized Film Replacement

Hope this helps other [ANYCUBIC Photon Mono 6.08'' 2K Monochrome LCD 3D Printer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0793PYDF7) users out there.

**Words to the wise:**

  1. Ensure your film sheet is at a 0° rotation before lining up to the guide cutting sheet. An angle of 105° will not work.
  2. Complete insturctions can be found here in this article: [How to fix the screen on your Anycubic Photon Mono-X](http://www.elitegeek.net/how-to-fix-the-screen-on-your-anycubic-photon-mono-x/) which is what I originally found but noticed that the file didn't fully suit my needs as the guide sheet is too big for my smaller mono.
  3. There's no warenty here on this. Be sure you understand what you're doing when you replace this.
  4. Eye protection is essential. UV radiation is dangerous to your eyes.

I had so much trouble replacing the lcd polarizing film on my photon mono 2k and I'm dropping this here because I had to make it to get exactly what I wanted.

Checkered area is the area of the actual LCD screen glass and the solid lip region is where it would overlay where the glass stops (I measure it at about 1/4 of an inch.) I left this like this because it's been necessary to give it a little play for final adjustments before the thermal and black tape.

This is the needed image at 15°
