##Hope this  helps those ![ANYCUBIC Photon Mono 3D Printer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0793PYDF7/), UV LCD Resin 3D Printer Fast Printing with 6.08'' 2K Monochrome LCD users out there.

Files helpful for LCD polarizing film repair on the Photon Mono 2k version.

I had so much trouble replacing the lcd polarizing film on my photon mono 2k and I'm dropping this here because I had to make it to get exactly what I wanted.

Checkered area is the area of the actual LCD screen glass and the solid lip region is where it would overlay with the lip trails off. I left this like this because it's been necessary to give it a little play for final adjustments before the thermal and black tape.
