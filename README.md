## Photon Mono2k 
Files helpful for LCD polarizing film repair on the Photon Mono 2k version.

I'm making 
I had so much trouble replacing the lcd polarizing film on my photon mono 2k and I'm dropping this here because I had to make it to get exactly what I wanted.

Checkered area is the area of the actual LCD screen glass and the solid lip region is where it would overlay with the lip trails off. I left this like this because it's been necessary to give it a little play for final adjustments before the thermal and black tape.

Hope this  helps those photon mono 2k users out there.

This is what I used:
